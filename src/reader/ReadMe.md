Hello,

I have limited experience of using Python in recent years, so I've had to do a quick refresher and I've done my best to follow what I believe are the current best practices.

I've done this work on my Macbook, from what I've read you should be able to download the code from my github, run pip install and the setup.py file should setup the dependencies and run the main.py file.

The code obtains the stock performance of companies using their ticker from Yahoo Finance, writes them to a csv file for each ticker, does what I acknowledge is limited transformation of the data by adding a column to the csv, re-writing the csv, and then displaying each tickers performance in a graph.  The start date, end date and tickers used on Yahoo Finance should be changeable should you wish to do so.  I've included backup copies of the csv in the package just in case.

I hope this all works for you.  If it doesn't I am happy to share what I can discuss on the work I have done in recent years in a professionaly capacity.

Regards,

Ross
